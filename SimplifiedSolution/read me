note: This is a simplified version which uses PostgreSQL, the user can search for universities depending on what he wants. 


I used 4521 as the password of the database. 
Simplified version. 
I used PostgreSQL instead of mysql to remove the error. 
Created the database called college_finder on pgAdmin locally. 
Create a Virtual Environment to run it. 
Installed the required packaged. 
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* pip install psycopg2-binary (required to fix error in PostgreSQL)
populate the database using:
* python -m my_project.populate_db
run the project inside the environment: 
* python -m my_project.run
